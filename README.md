# Rhaptor

This repository contains the main source code files relevant to my project. I have uploaded:

* My 3 Unity 3D Environments (The projects were too large, even after compression. Since almsot all the relevant scirpts I used to build the RHapTor interface was in the Assets Folder of each environemnt, only they were uploaded. I have also included the `log.txt` file which had the raw tracking data my C# scripts picked form the last participant, full dataset available in Data Analysis folder)
* My Arduino Sketches from the development of my haptic rendering algorithms. `final.ino` contains the script with all algorithms.
* Representative figrues of my work
* Python Data Analysis Scripts
